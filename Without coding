//Evaluate below expression without running the code
int x = 9, y = 12;
int a = 2, b = 4, c = 6;
int exp = 4/3 * (x + 34) + 9 * (a + b * c) + (3 + y * (2 + a)) / (a + b*y);
	Note: No program is required. Just give value of exp by calculating manually
  
  
ANSWER--------------  
 = 1*43+9*26+(3+y*4))/50
	=  1*43+9*26+51/50	
	=  43+234+1
	=  278 (ANS)
